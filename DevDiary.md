🌟 What worked well for you during the CCL?

So I think the first thing I really liked was of courses the designing part. I really enjoyed doing this and having the freedom of
doing everything I want to do, which made me feel even more engaged with the project tbh. and was ofc the first moment of success and tbh
who does like it when a design and prototype is fished and is working just fine. but in the Coding process tbh everything  was like a moment of success because
I still struggle sometimes with coding and due to a private family situation which made me stop for almost a week it felt even greater to start again
and push  through. so yeah a big moment is always when something just starts working so every step from design to the frontend and ofc in the end the hosting(which was a struggle, jesus christ)
I just feel proud I did it <3

🧩 What were your biggest challenges or struggles?

So my biggest struggles in general were typos and git best practices. I guess the typos r because im just always a little all over the place and a little to excited, and then I make mistakes
which is super annoying but on the other hand very funny, and then I always have the same thought of "oh ist just a typo, im not stupid im just distracted haha upsi"
The other thing is git best practice, I don't know why or maybe because I did most of my work always at random time and places, but I always forgot to commit which in the end is so
annoying cause sometimes I try new stuff, and then it just doesn't work, or I don't like it, and then I have to go the hard and long way back, which is  stupid lets be honest
Mea Culpa I would say.

🔍 What did you manage to understand better during these two weeks?

thanks to the ccl and I think because we can choose our own topic, which makes u more engaged I really wanted to make my design work properly and nice So I really dig into css and html and tbh it's not perfect
and I think in the end the design I choose was a little too hard maybe because I wanted to full-fill my own artsy crafty mind thing.
another big thing was that I keep it cool and don't think the world ends when something does not work. as I  said before most of the time it was just a typo.
and ofc I really got the hang of the whole backend and database situation, I mean thanks to the ssc and the oral exam in ssc I really thought I should get it
but thanks to the ccl and then the aspect of making it suitable to ur own liking and personalising it I really got the hang of it finally.
in the end I just can say that I am so proud of myself and even though maybe not is exactly how i imagined I did it and hosted it and really stand behind it. In the end, the uni gives us with the CCL,
a really cool opportunity to show our skills in our own way and ofc the end of the semester is due to that super stressful but on the other hand u finish the semester really proud and with a
project u came up with yourself and that is by far the nicest experience.

🕳️ What do you still struggle with?

ok first of all, I still struggle with the hosting of the website, same as last year and I really don't know why haha, because like it is written down perfectly ,but it still takes me two hours to just host it which
sometimes feel ridiculous. Another think is staying focused like I said before the main thing are these teeny tiny careless mistakes
which led to not so teeny tiny errors, but I think over time I got better at debugging and error handling because now I does not take me half a day to find the mistakes

🚀 Looking back to the start of the semester: Did you think you’d be able to build the app you delivered? Why or why not?

Tbh yes I thought so. but not because I believe so big in my own skills( which ofc I should do) but more because I knew from the last semester I made it work
even though I thought I would not.
