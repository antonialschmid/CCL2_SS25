🌟 What worked well for you during the CCL?

So i think the first thing i really liked was of courses the designing part. i really enjoyed doing this and having the freedom of
doing everything i want to do, which made me feel even more engaged with the projekt tbh. and was ofc the first moment of seccuess and tbh
who does like it when a design and protoype is fished and is working just fine. but in the Coding process tbh everything  was like a moment of success cause
i still struggle sometimes with coding and due to a privat family situation which made me stop for almost a week it felt even graeter to start again
and push  thtough. so yeah a big moment is always when something jsut starts working so everystep from design to the forntend and ofc in the end the hosting(which was a struggle, jesus chirst)
i just feel proud i did it <3

🧩 What were your biggest challenges or struggles?

So my biggest struggles in genreal were typos and and git best pracitces. i guess the typos r because im just always a little all over the place and a little to excited and then i make mistakes
which is super annoying but on the other hand exremly funny and then i always have the same tgouht of "oh ist just a typo, im not stupid im just distracted haha upsi"
The other thing is git best practice, i dont know why or maybe because i did most of my work always at random time and places but i always forgot too commit which in the end is so
annoying cause sometimes i try new stuff and then it just doesnt work or i dont like it and then i have to go the hard and long way back, which is fuckign stupid lets be honest
Mea Culpa i would say.

🔍 What did you manage to understand better during these two weeks?

thanks to the ccl and i think because we can choose our own topic, ehich makes u more engaged i really wanted to make my desing work properly and nice So i really dig into css and html and tbh its not perfekt
and i think in the end the design i choose was a little too hard maybe because i wanted to full fill my own artsy crafty mind thing.
another nbig thing was that i keep it cool and dont think the world ends when sometihng does not work. as i  said before msot of the time it was jsut a typo.
and ofc i really got the hang of the whole backend and databse situation, i mean thanks to the ssc and the oral exam in ssc i really thought i sould get it
but thanks to the ccl and then the aspect of making it suitable to ur own liking and perosnalising it i really got the hang of it finally.
in the end i jsut can say that i am so proud of my self and even though maybe not is exactly how i imagend i did it and hsoted it and really stand behinde it. In the end, the uni gives us with the CCL,
a really cool opertunity to anwednen our skills in our own way and ofc the end of the semester is due to that super stressful but on the other hand u finosh the semester really proud and with a
project u came up with urself and that is by far the most nicesest expierence.

🕳️ What do you still struggle with?

ok first of all, i still struggle with the hosting of the website, same as last year and i really dont knoe ehy haha, because like it is written down perfectly but it still takes me2 hourse to just host it which
sometimes feel ridicoulys. Another think is staying focused like i said before the main thing are these teeny tiny careless mistakes
which led to not so teeny tiiny errors, but i think over time i got better at debugging and error handeling because now i does not take me half a day to fidn the mistakes

🚀 Looking back to the start of the semester: Did you think you’d be able to build the app you delivered? Why or why not?

Tbh yes i thouhgt so. but not because i belive so big in my own skills( which ofc i should do) but more because i knew from the last semester i made it work
even though i thought i would not.
