# Dear Body

**Dear Body** is a poetic, blog-based web application where users can write anonymous
letters to their body or specific body parts.  
The project creates a soft and personal digital space for reflection, emotional
release, and intimacy.

This project was developed as a **solo project** for **Creative Code Lab 2 (CCL2)**
at FH St. Pölten.



## 🌸 Project Idea

Writing to the body is framed as an act of care rather than performance.
By removing public identity and usernames, the platform encourages vulnerability
without visibility pressure.

The visual and conceptual inspiration comes from **zines, diaries, and feminist
publishing**, translating these practices into a digital environment.



## 🧭 Features

- Public feed of anonymous letters (no login required)
- Login & registration for writing and resonating
- Writing letters addressed to the body or body parts
- All letters appear anonymous to other users
- User profile with personal letters
- Admin functionality for moderation



## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Architecture:** MVC
- **Hosting:** FH St. Pölten Campus Cloud




## 📄 Documentation

## 🧠 Reflection

This project focuses on process, experimentation, and learning.
While not everything turned out exactly as initially envisioned, the project
is fully implemented, hosted, and reflects both technical and conceptual growth.
