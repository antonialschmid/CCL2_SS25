        <h2>Project Idea</h2>

        <p>
            <em>Dear Body</em> is a poetic, blog-based web application where users can write
            anonymous letters to their body or to specific body parts.
            The act of writing is framed as a form of self-address, care,
            and emotional reflection.
        </p>

        <p>
            By removing public identity and usernames, the platform encourages
            vulnerability without performance. Letters are not written <em>for</em>
            others, but exist as quiet, personal statements within a shared space.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Motivation & Background</h2>

        <p>
            The project is inspired by zines, diaries, and feminist publishing practices
            that treat writing as an intimate and political act.
            Rather than focusing on productivity, optimisation, or visibility,
            <em>Dear Body</em> explores digital spaces as sites of care.
        </p>

        <p>
            Writing to the body allows users to externalise thoughts, emotions,
            and tensions that are often difficult to articulate.
            The web application functions as a container for these expressions,
            rather than a system that evaluates or ranks them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>User Flow</h2>

        <p>
            The application distinguishes between reading and writing:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Visitors can read letters without creating an account</li>
            <li>Writing letters and resonating with others requires login</li>
            <li>All letters are published anonymously</li>
            <li>Logged-in users can view their own letters on their profile page</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This structure lowers the barrier to engagement while preserving
            a sense of intentionality around participation.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Design Approach</h2>

        <p>
            Visually, the project combines softness and rawness.
            A bold pink background, red typography, pixel fonts,
            and scanned textures reference both digital nostalgia
            and handmade publishing.
        </p>

        <p>
            The interface avoids dense information layouts.
            Instead, it prioritises space, rhythm, and legibility,
            allowing text to remain the central element.
        </p>
    </div>
