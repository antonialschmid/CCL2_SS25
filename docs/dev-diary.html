        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            What worked best for me during CCL2 was the design phase. Having full creative
            freedom made me feel deeply engaged with the project. Seeing the design and
            prototype come together was the first major success moment.
        </p>

        <p>
            During development, almost every working feature felt like a small success.
            Especially after a private break, coming back and pushing through made the
            progress feel even more meaningful. Hosting was a struggle, but finishing the
            project and standing behind it made me genuinely proud.
