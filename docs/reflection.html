    <!-- ================= WHAT WORKED ================= -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What worked well during the CCL?</h2>

        <p>
            The first thing I really enjoyed was, of course, the design phase.
            Having the freedom to decide on the topic and visual direction made
            me feel deeply engaged with the project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Seeing the design and prototype come together was the first big moment
            of success — honestly, who doesn’t love it when a prototype is finished
            and works exactly as intended?
        </p>

        <p>
            During the coding phase, almost every step felt like a small success.
            Since I still struggle with coding at times, every working feature
            felt meaningful. Due to a private family situation, I had to pause
            for almost a week, which made coming back and pushing through even
            more rewarding.
        </p>

        <p>
            From design to frontend, backend, and finally hosting (which was a
            struggle — not gonna lie), I genuinely feel proud of having completed
            the project.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= CHALLENGES ================= -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Biggest challenges and struggles</h2>

        <p>
            My biggest struggles were, once again, typos and Git best practices.
            The typos mostly happen because I tend to get a bit too excited and
            move too fast — which is annoying, but also kind of funny in hindsight.
            Most of the time, the issue really was just a typo.
        </p>

        <p>
            Git was another challenge. Because I often worked at different times
            and places, I frequently forgot to commit. This became especially
            frustrating when trying new things that didn’t work out, forcing me
            to manually undo changes instead of simply rolling back.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mea culpa.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= LEARNINGS ================= -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What I managed to understand better</h2>

        <p>
            Thanks to CCL and the freedom to choose my own topic, I became much more
            invested in making the design work properly. I spent a lot of time
            digging into CSS and HTML. While the result isn’t perfect, it helped
            me understand layout, structure, and styling much better.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another important learning was staying calm when things didn’t work.
            I learned that most errors were not catastrophic — they were usually
            just small mistakes. This mindset made debugging much easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also finally got a solid grasp of backend and database concepts.
            While I had learned the theory before, applying it to a personal
            project and adapting it to my own ideas made everything click.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, even though the result might not be exactly how I imagined
            it at the start, I built it, hosted it, and I stand behind it.
            That alone makes me very proud.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= STILL STRUGGLING ================= -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What I still struggle with</h2>

        <p>
            Hosting is still something I struggle with — just like last year.
            Even though the steps are clearly documented, it still takes me
            much longer than I’d like to deploy a project.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another ongoing challenge is staying focused. Small, careless mistakes
            sometimes lead to larger errors. However, I’ve definitely improved at
            debugging and error handling, and it no longer takes me half a day to
            find simple issues.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= LOOKING BACK ================= -->

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Looking back at the start of the semester</h2>

        <p>
            Looking back, I did believe I would be able to build the app I delivered —
            not necessarily because I had full confidence in my skills, but because
            I knew from the previous semester that I had managed to make things work,
            even when I initially thought I wouldn’t.
